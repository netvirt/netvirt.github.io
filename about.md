NetVirt is a network virtualization platform that allows you to create and manage your
own peer-to-peer virtual private network (or Cloud Network) with the goal to keep it simple for everyone.
VPN and encryption are often only used by those who are knowledgeable and more skilled. Everyone
should be able to use a VPN-based technology.

"Cloud networks are similar to a virtual private network because they enable
users to securely access files, printers, applications, etc. from anywhere in the world,
on any device. However, cloud networks are multi-tenant private virtual cloud networks
that overlay the Internet. Each virtual cloud network functions like a borderless LAN
and provides fully switched, any-to-any connectivity between servers, PCs, and mobile
devices from anywhere" - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud-based_networking)
